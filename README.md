# Transit Dependent Population Weighting Map Tool

This repository hosts a free and open-source mapping tool that allows users to map socioeconomic vulnerability indicators that go into a "transit dependency index." The selected indicators come from [Pang (2019)](https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/61339/pang_jian_option_paper.pdf). A demonstration app was built for AC Transit's general service area, available at link below.

This app is built from the [vulnerability weighting tool](https://github.com/BPSTechServices/vulnerability_weighting_map).
